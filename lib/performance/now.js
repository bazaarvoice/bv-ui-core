/**
 *  @fileOverview Provides a cross-browser safe way to use the Navigation Timing API
 *  Ported from Firebird's scout directory
 *  Based on https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5438650
 *
 *  Note: this is not a true polyfill in browsers that do not implement the
 *  Navigation Timing API.  Rather than returning the time elapsed since
 *  `navigationStart`, it will return the time elapsed since the polyfill was
 *  installed.
