/**
 * Check for the existence of a builtin fetch function, and return it if it

 * checks for the existence of a 'self' variable to attach itself to, and
 * otherwise, will attach itself to the global object. Because of that, create
 * a global.self reference for it to attach to, caching any preexisting value,
 * and restoring the preexisting value after load, exporting the polyfill (and
 * its supporting data types) from this module.
 *
 * In the case of an existing builtin fetch, return it and its supporting data
 * types from this module, so that any module that needs fetch or its supporting
 * data types can import all of them from here, whether they're preexisting or
 * not.
